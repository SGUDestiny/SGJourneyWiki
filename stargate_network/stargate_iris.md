# Stargate Iris

> The iris is a metal covering on the Earth Stargate which is used to screen incoming traffic.  
> When the iris is closed, it forms a barrier less than three Î¼m from the wormhole's event horizon, 
> thereby preventing most forms of matter from properly reintegrating.

Stargate is a gateway to other worlds, hiding many things to discover but also many dangers.

Surely, you don't want any uninvited visitors; 
there is a very *democratic* way of preventing such occurrences -- build a wall and let every visitor smash into it, 
and by the wall, I mean the iris.

## Crafting an iris

To craft an iris, you will need a Stargate shielding ring first
which you can craft with four iron ingots and four redstone dusts.

Then you can use the ring in the middle of crafting table and surround it with a material for the [iris type](#iris-types).
